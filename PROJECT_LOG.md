### **Log Entry: #002**
**Date:** 2024-02-23
**Author:** Sam (The Documentarist)
**Status:** Core Service & UI Implementation

#### Summary:
Implemented foundational client connections and the first set of user-facing pages, enabling the basic user flow from landing to submitting a request.

#### Key Decisions & Accomplishments:

1.  **Client Initializers:**
    *   Created `/lib/supabase-client.ts` to provide a reusable Supabase client instance.
    *   Created `/lib/redis-client.ts` for future use with caching and queues.

2.  **User Interface (UI):**
    *   Built the public landing page (`/app/page.tsx`).
    *   Implemented the user authentication page (`/app/login/page.tsx`) using the `@supabase/auth-ui-react` component library.
    *   Created the first version of the user dashboard (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) with a form to submit exam creation requests.

3.  **Backend API:**
    *   Created the initial API endpoint (`/app/api/exam/route.ts`) to securely handle exam creation requests, validate user sessions, and insert a 'pending' record into the database.

### **Log Entry: #003**
**Date:** 2024-02-24
**Author:** Sam (The Documentarist)
**Status:** Phase 1 (ExamForge) Completion

#### Summary:
Developed the core AI processing logic and integrated it with a dynamic, real-time dashboard. This completes the primary feature loop for Phase 1 of ExamForge, including full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

#### Key Decisions & Accomplishments:

1.  **AI Integration:**
    *   Installed the `@google/generative-ai` SDK to connect to the Gemini API.
    *   Built the AI worker at `/app/api/process-exam/route.ts` to handle exam generation.

2.  **Dashboard Enhancement:**
    *   Completely refactored `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to be a fully interactive hub with real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions.
    *   Added a "View" modal, "Copy to Clipboard", and "Delete" functionality for exams.
    *   Added user controls for specifying the number of questions.

### **Log Entry: #004**
**Date:** 2024-02-25
**Author:** Sam (The Documentarist)
**Status:** Phase 2 (EduCraft) Implementation Complete

#### Summary:
Built the full feature set for EduCraft, the AI Course Outliner. Integrated it into the main application alongside ExamForge in a scalable, tabbed interface.

#### Key Decisions & Accomplishments:

1.  **Database:**
    *   Added a new `courses` table to the database with appropriate RLS policies to store course outline data.

2.  **Backend API:**
    *   Created `POST /api/course` for creating new course outline requests.
    *   Created `DELETE /api/course/[id]` for deleting course outlines.
    *   Built the AI worker at `POST /api/process-course` to handle the generation of course content via the Gemini API.

3.  **Dashboard UI:**
    *   Refactored the dashboard into a tabbed interface to support multiple tools (ExamForge & EduCraft).
    *   Implemented a dedicated form and list view for creating and managing course outlines.
    *   Added a second real-time subscription to the `courses` table for live UI updates.
    *   Added a "View" modal and "Copy to Clipboard" functionality for completed course outlines.
    *   Implemented the "Delete" functionality for courses.

### **Log Entry: #005**
**Date:** 2024-02-26
**Author:** Sam (The Documentarist)
**Status:** Phase 3 (Quiz Lab) & Gamification Completion

#### Summary:
Built the full feature set for Quiz Lab, the gamified quiz generator. This includes the quiz player, score saving, and a global leaderboard, completing the initial vision for the application.

#### Key Decisions & Accomplishments:

1.  **Database:**
    *   Added `quizzes` and `quiz_attempts` tables to store quiz data and user scores.
    *   Created a `get_leaderboard` PostgreSQL function for efficient score aggregation.
    *   Created a `get_my_rank` PostgreSQL function to calculate a single user's rank.

2.  **Backend API:**
    *   Created `POST /api/quiz` for creating new quizzes and `DELETE /api/quiz/[id]` for deletion.
    *   Built the AI worker at `POST /api/process-quiz` to generate the "Game JSON" with questions, answers, and feedback.
    *   Created `POST /api/quiz/attempt` to save user scores to the database.
    *   Created `GET /api/leaderboard` to serve the aggregated leaderboard data.
    *   Created `GET /api/leaderboard/my-rank` to serve a single user's rank data.

3.  **Dashboard & UI:**
    *   Integrated Quiz Lab as a new tab in the dashboard.
    *   Built a fully interactive quiz player modal with progress tracking, scoring, and instant feedback.
    *   Created a new `/leaderboard` page to display top user scores.
    *   Added a "My Rank" component to the leaderboard for a personalized experience.
    *   Added a link to the leaderboard in the dashboard header for easy access.

### **Log Entry: #006**
**Date:** 2024-02-27
**Author:** Sam (The Documentarist)
**Status:** PWA & Offline Capabilities

#### Summary:
Transformed the web application into a downloadable Progressive Web App (PWA) to provide a native app-like experience on mobile devices, with a focus on offline functionality for the Quiz Lab.

#### Key Decisions & Accomplishments:

1.  **PWA Scaffolding:**
    *   Installed `next-pwa` to manage service worker generation.
    *   Created `public/manifest.json` to define the app's name, icons, and display behavior.
    *   Updated `app/layout.tsx` to link the manifest and add mobile-specific metadata.

2.  **Service Worker Configuration (`next.config.mjs`):**
    *   **Runtime Caching:** Implemented a `StaleWhileRevalidate` strategy for Supabase API calls. This allows users to view previously loaded exams, courses, and quizzes even when offline.
    *   **Background Sync:** Implemented a `NetworkOnly` strategy with a `backgroundSync` queue for the `/api/quiz/attempt` endpoint. This ensures that if a user completes a quiz while offline, their score is saved automatically once their connection is restored.
